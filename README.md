# OnlineCompilerUpdate

Current Meta: Compiler updates based on static graph with some heuristic/cheap measure where given some static graph you determine the optimal run config(in our case we only look at the best computational graph sequence which is NP-hard problem meaning we can't solve search problem using traditional optimization framework; alternative configs would mostly be device allocation which becomes more important for distributed training where theres additional constraint of bandwidth latency; also dif problem is scheduling which from my understanding is just how do i optimize the hyperparams(kind of ?) when given some graph so more so mem allocation stuff). given all this, we instead want to we instead want to break from the static assumption entirely, and propose a system where:
- instead of given static make some optimization
- i wait till runtime so we instead , observe actual input shapes, routing decisions, and device load, then choose fusion/scheduling decisions just-in-timeâ€”based on a lightweight, learned decision policy

Expected Plan: 
- Start by training a 1mb GNN-cost model using some kind of Bandit-feedback system(need to decide the loss):  based on all this, we instead
